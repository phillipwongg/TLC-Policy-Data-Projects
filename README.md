# TLC-Policy-Data-Projects
These are many of the various projects I have worked on while an Urban Fellow placed at the NYC TLC on the Policy and Data teams. My work at TLC on the data side includes analyzing internal data collected on all Uber, Lyft, and taxi rides, as well as external data via NYC Open Data, NHTSA, and other external stakeholders.

The scope of my projects has varied from completing FOIL requests, such as determining monthly mileages for each For-Hire-Vehicle (FHV) industries, to creating a more complete dataset on TLC-licensed vehicles by combining trip data with data pulled from the NHTSA API, to programming a variety of maps, incluidng one to visualize commission rates for High-Volume FHV companies (Uber/Lyft) and another to interactively determine which elected officials represent the various zip codes where TLC-licensed drivers reside.
